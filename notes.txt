CS212 Java - OOP


Object oriented programming is about:
	Encapsulation - Everything is inside of something else think "class"
								- DEFINITION: a programming technique that binds data and code together. 
								              it manipulates and keeps it safe from outside interference.

	Polymorphism - even though things can be grouped together, parts of those things can be changed
			         - DEFINITION: is the quality that allows one interface to access a  class of actions
	
	Inheritance - 
	Garbage Collection - Don't need to worry about memory leaks
